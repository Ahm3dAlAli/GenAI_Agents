# AI Research Paper Assistant

***What's the Idea:*** 
Let's be real - diving into academic research is overwhelming. We're targeting researchers, students, and professionals who need help navigating and understanding scientific literature. Like many, they:
* Get lost in endless paper searches and citations
* Struggle to quickly grasp key findings from dense academic texts
* Need help connecting findings across multiple papers
* Want an intelligent assistant to help them stay current in their field

We're creating an AI-powered Research Assistant that transforms how people interact with academic literature. Our system uses AI to create a seamless research experience - not just another paper search tool.

**Use Case:**
The project will demonstrate how to build a Research Paper Analysis Agent that:
* Searches across multiple academic repositories through their APIs
* Downloads and processes papers intelligently
* Provides detailed answers about specific findings or research areas
* Maintains context across multiple papers for comprehensive understanding
* Generates citations and highlights relevant text sections

**What's the Goal:**
Create a comprehensive, step-by-step Jupyter notebook that shows how to:
1. Connect to Academic Sources:
   * arXiv API for preprints
   * Semantic Scholar API for broader academic search
   * PubMed Central API for biomedical research
   * CORE API for open access papers
   * Google Scholar (through scholarly library)

2. Build Processing Pipeline:
   * v0: Direct text extraction and processing
   * v1: Advanced PDF processing with unstructured.io
     - Text extraction with layout preservation
     - Table detection and structured data extraction
     - Figure and image extraction
     - Mathematical formula handling

3. Implement Question-Answering System:
   * Context window management for large papers
   * Multi-paper context handling
   * Citation generation with page numbers
   * Result highlighting and explanation

**Tech Stack:**
* Python (Jupyter Notebook)
* Paper Processing:
  - PyPDF2 for basic PDF handling
  - unstructured.io for advanced extraction
  - scholarly for Google Scholar access
* APIs:
  - arxiv library
  - semanticscholar
  - biopython for PubMed
* LLM Integration:
  - LangChain for orchestration
  - ChromaDB for vector storage
  - OpenAI API for processing

**Implementation Phases:**

1. Basic Version (v0):
* Simple text-based paper processing
* Single paper context window
* Basic question-answering

2. Advanced Version (v1):
* PDF processing with structure preservation
* Multi-paper context handling
* Visual element extraction
* Interactive follow-up questions
* Citation management

**Nice to Have Features:**
* Interactive visualization of paper relationships
* Export functionality for citations and notes
* Collaborative research sessions
* Integration with reference managers
* Real-time paper monitoring for specific topics

**Future Enhancements:**
* Browser extension for direct paper access
* Custom training on specific research domains
* Integration with academic writing tools
* Automated literature review generation
* Research trend analysis and visualization
